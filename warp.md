## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### AI Assistant Code Architecture
```javascript
// Smart AI behavior system implemented by Warp AI
updateEnemies() {
    enemies.forEach(enemy => {
        // Decision-making system
        if (now - enemy.ai.lastDecision > 500) {
            const distToPlayer = calculateDistance();
            
            if (distToPlayer < 100) {
                enemy.ai.state = 'attack';
            } else if (distToPlayer > 300) {
                enemy.ai.state = 'hunt';
            } else {
                enemy.ai.state = Math.random() < 0.7 ? 'hunt' : 'flank';
            }
        }
        
        // Execute AI behavior
        executeAIBehavior(enemy);
    });
}

// Advanced Boss AI system
updateBoss() {
    if (now - boss.ai.lastDecision > 800) {
        const distToPlayer = calculateDistance();
        
        if (distToPlayer > 300) {
            boss.ai.state = 'approach';
        } else if (distToPlayer < 150) {
            boss.ai.state = 'retreat';
        } else {
            boss.ai.state = 'circle';
            boss.ai.circleAngle += 0.3;
        }
    }
    
    // Boss shooting with pattern cycling
    if (now - boss.lastShot > 1200) {
        bossShoot(); // Cycles through 3 attack patterns
    }
}
