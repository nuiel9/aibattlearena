- **Solution**: Pivoted to 2D top-down shooter with focus on AI mechanics

### Phase 2: Core Game Engine âœ…
- **Built custom 2D rendering engine** using HTML5 Canvas
- **Implemented game loop** with proper frame timing
- **Created modular game state management**
- **Established input handling system** (keyboard + mouse)

### Phase 3: AI Systems âœ…
- **Intelligent Enemy AI** with multiple behavior states:
  - `hunt`: Aggressive pursuit of player
  - `attack`: Close-range assault mode  
  - `flank`: Tactical positioning around player
- **Decision-making system** with timed AI updates (500ms intervals)
- **Dynamic AI scaling** - enemies get smarter/faster each wave

### Phase 4: Combat Mechanics âœ…
- **Projectile system** with realistic ballistics
- **Ammo management** with reload mechanics
- **Health system** for both player and enemies
- **Collision detection** for bullets/enemies/pickups
- **Visual feedback** with particle effects

### Phase 5: Game Progression âœ…
- **Wave-based gameplay** with increasing difficulty
- **Enemy variety**: Normal vs Fast enemy types
- **Pickup system**: Ammo and health restoration items
- **Scoring system**: Points for survival + kills
- **Progressive challenge**: More enemies per wave, increased stats
